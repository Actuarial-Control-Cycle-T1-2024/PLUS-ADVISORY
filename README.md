## Problem Statement
SuperLife, a prominent life insurance carrier in the country of Lumaria, is exploring the development of a health incentive program to complement its long-term life insurance products. Through the health program, Superlife seeks to incentivize healthy lifestyle behaviours and thereby decrease policyholder mortality rates, and boost sales volumes via enhanced marketability and industry competitivenes to ultimately yield economic benefits for the company. Plus Advisory has been engaged as an external consultancy to propose an innovative solution.

## Executive Summary
This showcase presents Plus Advisory’s proposed ‘wellness plan’ with detailed examination into the program design, modelling and evaluation process. These investigations were commissioned by *SuperLife Chief Actuary Jes B. Zane* to address several strategic social, financial and growth objectives for SuperLife’s long-term life insurance products. Included below is a comprehensive review of the initial data exploration, our health program design process, assumptions setting procedure, pricing-model construction methodology and forecasted economic benefits until 2044. To assess and support the long-term financial viability and profitability of the health program, sensitivity analyses and risk evaluations were also conducted. In recommending implementation of the health plan, there are further discussions of other considerations such as using gender-based pricing and devised marketing plans across Lumaria.

## Project Timeline
The chart below depicts the workflow progression of Plus Advisory's consultants in developing the solution.

## Risk Management
Significant quantitative and qualitative risks that may arise from the implementation of the health incentive program for SuperLife were identified and assessed. For each risk, ratings of the magnitude of impact and the possibility of occurrence are provided in this [risk matrix](Likelihood.png), alongside relevant mitigation strategies deduced to address these risks, outlined in the table below.

### Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the materiality of the financial impacts from favourable and unfavourable scenarios based on our key assumptions. The table below details the different scenarios investigated, the recommended range that our health plan will remain financially viable within and any insights gathered during the analysis.
